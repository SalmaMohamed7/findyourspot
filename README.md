Dependencies:
Axios: it is a Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript. By using Axios it's easy to send asynchronous HTTP request to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. ... Make http requests from node.
Express: handles things like cookies, parsing the request body, forming the response and handling routes. It also is the part of the application that listens to a socket to handle incoming requests.
Joi: it is a validation library that allows you to build schemas to validate JavaScript objects. And what that generally means is that Joi provides methods to easily validate common data types, such as e-mail addresses and phone numbers.
joi-objectid: validates that the value is an alphanumeric string of 24 characters in length
Moment: is a free and open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly. The library is a wrapper for the Date object (in the same way that jQuery is a wrapper for JavaScript) making the object a whole lot easier to work with.
Mongoose: it is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB
Node: allows us to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.
Docker is used as acontainer for the backend, it runs the backend using the command Docker-compose up --build
